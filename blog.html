                    Hey fellow dreamers! Today, I'm excited to share a personal milestone on my blog â€“ the rediscovery of a passion I started 22 years ago. Back in college, I was on the path to becoming a software engineer, but life had other plans, and I took a detour into the world of customer service.                    
                    Life's Twists and Turns:<br>
                    
                    After majoring in software engineering, unexpected turns led me away from my initial career path. Most of my professional life revolved around customer service, helping people with their tech-related concerns. While I found fulfillment in assisting others, a part of me always yearned to revisit my roots in software engineering.                
                </p>
                <h4>The Tech Stack I'm Building:</h4>
                <p>
                    As I embark on this journey, I'm delving into both front-end and back-end technologies. Here's a snapshot of what I willing be learning in this course:
                 </p>
                 <h4>Age as a Barrier:</h4>
                 <p>
                    Over the years, the idea of returning to what I started became a distant dream. I almost let my age become a barrier, doubting whether it was too late to dive back into the world of coding. The fear of not being able to catch up with the fast-paced tech advancements held me back.
                 </p>
                 <h4>2024: A Year of Resurgence:</h4>
                 <p>   
                    But here I am, declaring 2024 as my year of resurgence. It's time to overcome the self-imposed limitations and pursue the dreams I put on hold. Age is just a number, and the passion for coding doesn't have an expiration date.
                </p>
                <h4>Embracing Change:</h4>
                <p> 
                    I've realized that life is a journey, and it's never too late to course correct. Embracing change is a part of growth, and I'm ready to embark on this new chapter. The decision to go back to my roots in software engineering is fueled by a burning desire to reconnect with the thrill of coding.                
                </p>    
                <h4>The Journey Ahead:</h4>
                <p>       
                    As I take this leap, I invite you to join me on the journey. Together, let's navigate the challenges, celebrate the victories, and prove that pursuing our dreams knows no age boundaries. Whether you're considering a career change or revisiting a forgotten passion, remember that it's never too late to rewrite your story.
                    Here's to rediscovery, growth, and making 2024 the year we reclaim our dreams. Cheers to embracing the unknown and charting a course towards fulfillment! ðŸš€âœ¨

                    Hey there, tech enthusiasts! It's day 3 of my journey into the world of web development, and I'm thrilled to share my progress with you. As a 40-year-old manager leading a team in a tech support call center, diving back into HTML, CSS, and Javascript feels like a refreshing refresher after two decades.
                    
                    Getting My Hands Dirty with HTML: <br>
                    
                    I've just wrapped up the HTML section, and it's incredible how the basics remain the foundation of web development. Creating my first website in class was a nostalgic trip down memory lane. I'm planning to evolve it as I progress through the lessons, adding layers of complexity and functionality.
                </p>
                <h4>The Tech Stack I'm Building:</h4>
                <p>
                    As I embark on this journey, I'm delving into both front-end and back-end technologies. Here's a snapshot of what I willing be learning in this course:
                 </p>
                 <h4>Front-End:</h4>
                 <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML5: The backbone of web content.</li>
                        <li>CSS3: Adding style and aesthetics.</li>
                        <li>Javascript: Making things interactive.</li>
                        <li>React: Building dynamic user interfaces.</li>
                    </ul>
                 </p>
                 <h4>Back-End:</h4>
                 <p>   
                    <ul>
                        <li>Node Server: Enabling server-side scripting.</li>
                        <li>Node.js: The runtime for executing Javascript on the server.</li>
                        <li>Express.js: Simplifying the process of building web applications.</li>
                        <li>PostgreSQL: My relational database of choice.</li>
                        <li>MongoDB: Exploring the world of NoSQL databases.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>Reflecting on Past Technologies: </h4>
                <p> 
                    In my previous tech stack, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery were the building blocks for the front-end. On the back-end, the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) was the go-to setup. It's fascinating to see how the landscape has evolved over the years, with new technologies offering enhanced capabilities and efficiency.
                </p>    
                <h4>Navigating the World of Forms:</h4>
                <p>       
                    Understanding forms and their intricacies is crucial. I've dived into the query string, different methods (GET, POST), and actions on the backend (like action.php).
                </p>
                <h4>Looking Ahead:</h4>
                <p> 
                    With a renewed passion for coding, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. I aim to become a full-stack developer by the end of the year, armed with a comprehensive skill set that spans both front-end and back-end technologies.
                    
                    Join me on this exciting journey as I unravel the mysteries of web development, one line of code at a time. Cheers to learning and evolving in the ever-dynamic world of technology! ðŸš€âœ¨
